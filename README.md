# C Server Guacamole

copyright (c) 2017 Steph Oro

## About

This project provides a useful and well tested linked list c library of my design, as well as a string manipulation library also of my design.

This project contains examples of:
- reading/writing to the console without using printf/scanf
- sockets via sys/socket.h
- file descriptor sets
- select to listen to both a server, clients, and user command line input

## Compile/Run

This project was written for linux ubuntu precise build. This project was tested on precise.

You will have to compile the my library under src/my, the list library under src/list, and then sockettalk under src/sockettalk.
